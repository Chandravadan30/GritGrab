GritGrab is a dynamic web application built for UMBC students to monitor, manage, and optimize their Dining Dollars usage with ease. 
Developed using Streamlit, the app provides a secure login experience and a data-driven dashboard that visualizes real-time balance, daily and monthly spending patterns,
 and vendor-specific insights. GritGrab also includes an automated email alert system that notifies students when their balance drops below $20, 
prompting them to recharge their account to continue enjoying UMBC’s food services without disruption. With features like average spend per visit, 
top vendor tracking, and most expensive day analysis, GritGrab not only helps students stay on budget but also fosters mindful campus dining habits. 
Combining analytics with school spirit, GritGrab embodies UMBC’s grit and greatness in every bite.
